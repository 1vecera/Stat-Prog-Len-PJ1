Name of Quantlet: LeaguesPredictability

Published in: Statistical Programming Languages - Student Project on Analysis of a FIFA Dataset

Description: 'In this quantlet we are calculating the predictability of chosen leagues. We are using entropy as a proxy of the level of competitiveness of a certain league or a match. The entropy is calculated on the basis of probabilities which different outcomes of the matches have, which are, in its turn, retrieved from the bidding odds provided by a gambling agency. Datasets with mean entropy by leagues and teams were also created and exported to a file'

Keywords: Entropy, competitiveness, predictability
